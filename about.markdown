# Overview
The reaction wheel system was built as an endeavor to apply my interdisciplinary knowledge to a system type I had not
designed before. The goal is to emulate many aspects and design considerations during the design process of an attitude control system for a sattelite. To emulate closer to the needs of a real system I leveraged the friction from the bearings and slip-ring to emulate attitude disturbances. The main issue here is the fact that the reaction wheel will saturate and lose all control authority. The addition of this drag made for some interesting system identification procedures and Simulink modelling.
